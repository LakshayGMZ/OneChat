# OneChat

This is my first web and full stack project. This project is a chat app where people can come together and chat anonymously. My app provides user a platform to connect worldwide and chat in a single channel for everyone for now.


This project uses **MERN** stack technology to serve the best user experience.
- I have used **JWT** [JSON Web Tokens] for authentication.

- Used **SocketsIO** for live messages updates when someone sends a message in the chat room

- For security, I have used hashing and salting upto 12 rounds to store sensitive data and passwords in database.
